# Linked Lists

Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)

Find the Nth element in a linked list

Remove the Nth element of a linked list

Check if a linked list has cycles

Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop.

Ex. A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop

Check whether a link list is a palindrome

Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively

Given a linked list, where each node has a link to a random node in the list, make a copy of the entire list

Given a singly LL A->B->C->D->E->F... convert to B->A->D->C->F->E...
